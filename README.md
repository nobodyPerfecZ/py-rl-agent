## PyRLAgent: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Library
PyRLAgent is a comprehensive library featuring a suite of RL approaches implemented in Python. 
It provides a range of algorithms designed to facilitate the development and experimentation of RL models.


### Implemented RL Algorithms
PyRLAgent offers implementations of the following RL algorithms:
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
- Clipped Double Deep Q-Network (Clipped DDQN)
- C51
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

### Examples
In the `examples` directory, you can discover a variety of scripts demonstrating how to use different RL algorithms
across various Gymnasium environments.
