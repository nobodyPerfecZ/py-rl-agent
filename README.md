# pyrlagent: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Library 🌍
pyrlagent is a library featuring a suite of RL approaches implemented in Python/PyTorch/JAX.

## Implemented Algorithms 🤖
PyRLAgent offers implementations of the following RL algorithms:

- In PyTorch:
    - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

- In JAX:
    - TODO

## Installation ⚙️
TODO: Add text here

## TODOs ⛏
- Return the non-discounted returns for the train/eval function of RL algorithms
- Test the implementation of CNN networks
- Add the environments from gymboy inside of create_env/create_vec_env (coming soon)
- Implement DDPG methods (TD3, SAC, ...) in torch/jax
